# Visualization-of-COBE-Dean-s-List-Spring-2024-
This project uses SQL and Tableau to analyze the dataset of Boise State University COBE department Dean's List (Spring 2024). The goal of the project is to display number of students in a major, level and honor category.

## Project Overview 
This project involves data analytics using multiple tools to process, analyze, and visualize data. The primary tasks include data formatting in excel, data manipulation using SQL and data visualization with Tableau.


## Tools and Technologies Used
* Excel: Used for data formatting and initial preperation.
* SQLite (DB Browser for SQLite): Employed to query, manipulate, and group data for analysis.
* Tableau: Utilized for creating interactive visualizations to present the insights from the data.

## Project Overflow
### 1. Data Formatting (Excel):
* Imported raw data into Excel.
* Cleaned and formatted data to ensure consistency
### 2. Data Manipulation:
* Imported formatted data into a SQL database.
* Created queries to filter, group, and aggregate data as required.
* Generated datasets that provided meaningful insights.
### 3. Data Visualization (Tableau):
* Imported the final dataset into Tableau
* Designed interactive dashboards and charts to visualize key findings.

## How to Use this Project
### 1. Excel file: 
Open the excel file to review the formatted data and initial analysis.
### 2. SQL Queries: 
The SQL scripts provided can run on SQL-compatible database to replicate the data manipulation steps.
### 3. Tableau Workbook: 
Open the Tableau workbook to explore the visualizations. Make sure to connect it to the dataset.
## Installation and Setup:
### 1. Excel: 
Ensure you have a Excel (or a compatible spreadsheet tool) installed to view the formatted data.
### 2. SQL:
Use any SQL database (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL) to run the SQL scripts provided.
### 3. Tableau:
Install Tableau or prefered visualization tool to interact with the visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to effectively combine Excel, SQL, and Tableau for comprehensive data analysis. The workflow provides a clear path from raw data to actionalbe insights, making it easier to understand the dataset.
